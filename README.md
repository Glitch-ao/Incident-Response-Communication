# Incident Response Communication & Reporting

This project focused on reviewing key frameworks, guidelines, and reporting mechanisms related to incident response communication. I studied best practices from NIST and CISA, analyzed official incident reporting forms, and reviewed industry insights on the financial impacts of cyber incidents.

### Exercise 1: Coordination & Information Sharing
- Reviewed the **NIST Incident Handling Guide (SP 800-61 Rev.2)** with a focus on communication and coordination procedures during incidents.
- Analyzed the **CISA Cybersecurity Incident & Vulnerability Response Playbook** to understand federal-level response and stakeholder collaboration.
- Studied best practices for timely and accurate information sharing between internal teams and external entities (law enforcement, partners, regulators).

### Exercise 2: Required Incident Reports
- Reviewed and analyzed:
  - **CISA Incident Reporting Forms** (Cyber Hygiene and Vulnerability Disclosure)
  - **Federal Incident Notification Guidelines** for various breach types and severity levels
  - A standard **Information Security Incident Report Form** used by enterprises to log and escalate cybersecurity events

### Exercise 3: IBM 2022 Cost of a Data Breach Report
- Read the **IBM Security Cost of a Data Breach Report 2022**
- Key findings included:
  - Average cost of a breach: **$4.35 million**
  - Top contributing factors: Lost business, response delays, and lack of automation
  - Organizations with a tested IR plan saved on average **$2.66 million** per breach
